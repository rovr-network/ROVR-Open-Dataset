## ROVR Open Dataset Overview

### Dataset Volume
The first batch of the ROVR Open Dataset includes **1,363 clips**, each containing **30 seconds of data**, collected from diverse global environments to support autonomous driving research.

### Scene Coverage
The dataset spans three scene types, each with varied conditions to ensure comprehensive representation:

- **Highway**: High-speed road scenarios.
- **Urban**: City environments with complex traffic patterns.
- **Rural**: Less dense, open-road settings.

**Conditions**: Each scene type includes **Day**, **Night**, and **Rainy** conditions for robust scenario diversity.

### Dataset Split
The dataset is divided as follows:

- **Training Set**: 1,296 clips
- **Test Set**: 67 clips

### Annotations
- **Current**: Ground truth annotations are provided for **monocular depth estimation**.
- **Planned**: Annotations for **object detection** and **semantic segmentation** will be included in future releases.

### Future Releases
A second batch of data is planned for open-source release to further expand the datasetâ€™s scope and utility.

## Challenges
We will be hosting global challenges to advance autonomous driving research. These challenges will focus on the following areas:

- **Monocular Depth Estimation (Coming Soon):** Depth estimation algorithms using camera and LiDAR ground truth.
- **Fusion Detection & Segmentation (Coming Soon):** Real-time vehicle and obstacle detection using camera and LiDAR data, along with pixel-level segmentation.
