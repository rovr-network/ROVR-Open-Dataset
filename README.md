## Dataset Overview
ROVR Open Dataset includes various data types to support different autonomous driving tasks:

- **LiDAR Point Clouds:** Dense 3D point clouds for precise depth estimation and scene analysis.
- **Monocular Depth Estimation:** High-precision depth information to aid autonomous driving perception.
- **Object Detection:** Real-time detection of vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles.
- **Semantic Segmentation:** Pixel-level segmentation of roads, obstacles, and other features.

## Challenges
We will be hosting global challenges to advance autonomous driving research. These challenges will focus on the following areas:

- **Monocular Depth Estimation (Coming Soon):** Depth estimation algorithms using camera and LiDAR ground truth.
- **Fusion Detection & Segmentation (Coming Soon):** Real-time vehicle and obstacle detection using camera and LiDAR data, along with pixel-level segmentation.
